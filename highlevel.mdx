### Step 1: Create/Login to your Samurai Account 
[Head here to do this](http://app.samuraichat.com/login).

### Step 2: Highlevel CRM Setup

1. Create a Highlevel Account [Create a Highlevel account here](https://app.gohighlevel.com/).

### Step 3: Download the Snapshot

Download the snapshot [here](https://affiliates.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=45jgr&share=BHwxufzg3zRbo10owY5x). The snapshot will create:
   - An initial outreach sequence
   - A basic Q&A customer service chatbot that uses any messenger
   - An appointment setting chatbot that connects to the calendar and uses any messenger
   - A follow-up sequence

### Step 4: Create a Calendar and Get Calendar ID

Inside the snapshot, we have created a calendar called "Main Calendar - AI Bookings". Feel free to alter the calendar settings however you want. Add the calendar ID to the "Custom Value" for `calendar_id`.

### Step 5: Add The User ID

Get the User ID from the "Profile Settings" in Samurai. Add the `user_id` to customer values.

### Step 6: Complete Samurai AI Setup - Step 1

Head to the form called "Samurai AI Setup - Step 1" in your Highlevel account in teh "forms" section. Open the form, make sure that you have the required fields added, and click the button to complete the setup. This part of the setup creates a workspace and the assistants in Samurai.

### Step 7: Head back over to your Samurai Account

1. Head back over to your Samurai Account.
2. Click into the workspace we have created for you.
3. In your workspace, you'll see that we have created the basic required assistants.

### Step 8: Add the OpenAI Key

The OpenAI key is necessary for turning documents into embeddings. If you do not want to use OpenAI for your assistants, you can specify another chat model in a separate process.

1. Add the OpenAI key to the workspace (Required for embeddings).
2. When using OpenAI:
   - Ensure a card is on file.
   - Add credits in OpenAI.
   - Check [OpenAI Limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) to be in a "Paid Tier".
3. Free credits might be available for new OpenAI accounts or API keys.
4. Avoid rate limit errors by visiting [this guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

### Step 9: Set Up Connections

1. Head to the "Connections" tab.
2. Connect your Highlevel Account.
3. Select the "Location" and not the agency account.
4. Copy the `connection_id` and paste it into the customer value in Highlevel

### Step 10: Complete Samurai AI Setup - Step 2

Head to the form called "Samurai AI Setup - Step 2" in your Highlevel account in the "forms" section. Open the form, make sure that you have the required fields added, and click the button to complete the setup. This part of the setup creates tools for the assistants to use.

### Step 11: Add Files
1. The last step is to add files/collections of files so that the chatbot assistant is smarter:
   - Head to the "Files" tab.
   - Simply add files.
   - If you get an error:
     - Ensure the OpenAI API key is on file (Remember: OpenAI is used to turn documents into "embeddings" for assistants).
     - Add an OpenAI key if not already done (see above).
     - In the "name" field, include the file type:
       - **Good Example:** `test-FAQ.csv`
       - **Bad Example:** `test-FAQ`

### Step 12: Final Steps

1. Go back to Highlevel and in the custom values section, make sure to add the required custom values:
    - `user_id`: From the "Profile Settings" tab in your Samurai account.
    - `connection_id`: You can copy this from the "Connections" tab in your Samurai account.
    - `calendar_id`: This is from the calendar you made in Highlevel.

title: Highlevel CRM Snapshot
description: 'This guide will help you set up Samurai directly from your Highlevel CRM using a snapshot'
---

### Step 1: Create/Login to your Samurai Account 
[Head here to do this](http://app.samuraichat.com/login).

### Step 2: Add the OpenAI Key
The OpenAI key is necessary for turning documents into embeddings. If you do not want to use OpenAI for your assistants, you can specify another chat model in a separate process.

1. Add the OpenAI key to the workspace (Required for embeddings).
2. When using OpenAI:
   - Ensure a card is on file.
   - Add credits in OpenAI.
   - Check [OpenAI Limits](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) to be in a "Paid Tier".
3. Free credits might be available for new OpenAI accounts or API keys.
4. Avoid rate limit errors by visiting [this guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits).

### Step 3: Set Up Connections
1. Head to the "Connections" tab.
2. Connect your Highlevel Account.
3. Select the "Location" and not the agency account.
4. Copy the `connection_id` (So that we can paste it in later)

### Step 4: Highlevel CRM Setup

1. Create a Highlevel Account [Create a Highlevel account here](https://app.gohighlevel.com/).
2. Download the snapshot [here](https://affiliates.gohighlevel.com/?fp_ref=45jgr&share=HnAeVyQwUISDu4gr1ZpX). The snapshot will create:
    - An initial outreach sequence
    - A basic Q&A customer service chatbot that uses any messenger
    - An appointment setting chatbot that connects to the calendar and uses any messenger
    - A follow-up sequence
3. Add a location and use the snapshot.
4. Add all company information into the Highlevel Account.
5. Create a calendar in the Highlevel Account.
6. Add the calendar ID to the "Custom Value" for `calendar_id`.
7. Head to the form called "Samurai AI Setup". Open the form.
8. Make sure that you have the required fields added in the form, and click the button.
9. Voila! All of your chat assistants will be created.

> **Note:** Before you can use the chat assistants we have made for you, make sure to connect all of the messengers that you want to use in the location account.

### Step 5: Add Files

1. Head back over to your Samurai Account.
2. Click into the workspace we have created for you.
3. In your workspace, you'll see that we have created the basic required assistants.
4. The last step is to add files/collections of files so that the chatbot assistant is smarter:
   - Head to the "Files" tab.
   - Simply add files.
   - If you get an error:
     - Ensure the OpenAI API key is on file (Remember: OpenAI is used to turn documents into "embeddings" for assistants).
     - Add an OpenAI key if not already done (see above).
     - In the "name" field, include the file type:
       - **Good Example:** `test-FAQ.csv`
       - **Bad Example:** `test-FAQ`

### Step 6: Final Steps

1. Go back to Highlevel and in the customer values section, make sure to add the required custom values:

    - `user_id`: 
    - `connection_id`: This is the connection_id you can copy from your Samurai account.
    - `workspace_id`: This is the ID found in the URL browser tab when logged in to your Samurai Account.
    - `calendar_id`: This is from the calendar you made in Highlevel.
